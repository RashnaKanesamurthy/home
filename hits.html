				<h3>You Broke Me First</h3>
				<p> Her first biggest hit was "You Broke Me First" released on March 2020, when she was only 16. 
				This is when she got greater recognition for her songs. This song recieved over 1B+ streams on spotify!
				<br>
				<br>
				In an interview she explains the process of the music video. She mentioned that she told her friend to drive and to not look back at her because she taped her phone 
				on the car and started recording herself. The final piece ended up being better than what she expected and she was glad about 
				what she had made. She also mentions that this music video was created with a low-budget and did nothing to herself. This makes 
				the video more exceptional!</p>
